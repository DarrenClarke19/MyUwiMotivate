# MyUwiMotivate
Personal Project
Time Spent: 4 hours

Motivation CRUD application utilizing a quotes API : https://api.quotable.io/

Mental Health is a significant issue that many university students face. Considering the lack of efforts made towards remedying this issue, this project could potentially be integrated with different e-learning platforms.
This project is a Flask web application that demonstrates key web development concepts including JWT-based authentication, routing, template rendering, and basic CRUD operations. The application allows the following user stories:
N.b Users can include the following actors: Students,Lecturers, Teaching Assistants.


-Users can register and log in using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure secure login.

-Users can view a "Quote of the Day", fetched dynamically from a public quotes API (Quotable) to motivate themselves.

-Users can save motivational quotes to their personal list of favourites to go back to impactful quotes viewed previously.

-Users can delete quotes from their favourites list if they arent useful anymore.

-Users can change their account password if the original password is compromised.

-Users can delete their account entirely if they do not require an account anymore.

The user interface includes a responsive Materialize CSS-powered navbar, with actions like logout, password change, and account deletion clearly accessible. The backend handles all authentication, route protection, and database interactions through Flask SQLAlchemy.
This app is a functional showcase of user session management, API integration, and interactive UI with real-time updatesâ€”ideal for demonstrating full-stack development proficiency.

# Notes 
No major issues encountered apart from styling issues especially the navbar icons alignments. Thankfully, materialize css framework makes this easier.

# MyUwiMotivate
Motivation CRUD application utilizing a quotes API : https://api.quotable.io/

Mental Health is a significant issue that many university students face. Considering the lack of efforts made towards remedying this issue, this project could potentially be integrated with different e-learning platforms.
This project is a Flask web application that demonstrates key web development concepts including JWT-based authentication, routing, template rendering, and basic CRUD operations. The application allows a student user to:

-Register and log in securely using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

-View a "Quote of the Day", fetched dynamically from a public quotes API (Quotable).

-Save motivational quotes to their personal list of favourites.

-Delete quotes from their favourites list.

-Change their account password.

-Delete their account entirely.

The user interface includes a responsive Materialize CSS-powered navbar, with actions like logout, password change, and account deletion clearly accessible. The backend handles all authentication, route protection, and database interactions through Flask SQLAlchemy.
This app is a functional showcase of user session management, API integration, and interactive UI with real-time updatesâ€”ideal for demonstrating full-stack development proficiency.
